# SICSS Istanbul 2021 - Covid Vaccine Perception in Turkey 
The aim of this work is to understand how frequency and sentiment of Covid-19 vaccines' nomenclatures changed over time.
The manufacturing of vaccines plays an important role for Covid-19 pandemic to be contained. There are currently about half a dozen leading vaccine manufacturers in late-stage trials, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), including three in China, one in the UK, one in the US, and a German-US partnership. We would like to investigate:

**1-)** How the nomenclature of vaccines differs in Turkey and how it is reflected on the attitude toward vaccination

**2-)** Whether any of these vaccines are promoted or demoted by the international media sources that are active in Turkey by looking at the sentiments and frequencies of Covid-19 related vaccine news.

**3-)** Whether pronoun usage differs according to the sentiment of tweets.

**4-)** If there is any observable effect of the number of bots on social perception toward vaccination.
